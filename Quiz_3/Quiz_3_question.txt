1. This product is an open-source application server (i.e. middleware) with the cycle time between releases of 1 year (i.e. 4 quarters). So its defect arrival curve would follow a Weibull distribution of which shape parameter is of 2.

Determine the scale parameter of this distribution.

2. Estimate the total number of reported defects after 1st quarter, and after 2nd quarter. What is the relative error compared to the actual total amount of reported defects.

3. After 2nd quarter, estimate the number of defects reported in 3th quarter and in 4th quarter. What is the relative error compared to the actual amount of reported defects.
