In this assignment, you will perform experiments with defect predictors. You should evaluate with the following options for predictors:

1. LOC: the number of lines of code, i.e. the simplest code metric

2. NBF: the number of bugs found previously, i.e. the simplest bug metric

3. NOV: the number of versions of the source file, i.e. the simplest change metric

4. The single code metric (and change metric) that have highest correlation (which you have discovered in Assignment 1)

5. All code metrics

6. All change metrics

7. All available metrics

If you use multiple metrics (in the last three cases), you will perform with two options:

8. Use all metrics

9. Perform PCA for all metrics and only choose the first k principal components with cumulative variances of at least 90%.

You need to perform experiments for all five datasets and use both "mean absolute error" (MAE) and "ranked correlation" (RCOR) as measures of prediction performance.
